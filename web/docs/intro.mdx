# deployEMDS

**[deployEMDS](https://deployemds.eu/)** is a project co-funded under the **[EU Digital Europe Programme](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/digital-programme)** and responds to its outlined challenges. The project will help make the common European mobility data space a reality. The initiative will cultivate a broad European ecosystem of data providers and users, facilitating the adoption of common building blocks. Sixteen use cases from nine EU countries will contribute to the development of innovative services and applications.

The *European mobility data space (EMDS)* will offer a framework for interlinking and federating ecosystems. deployEMDS supports the EMDS initiative through:
* **Data interoperability:** Sharing and exchanging data in a standardised way
* **Data sovereignty and trust:** Retaining authority and control over data
* **Accessibility:** Discoverability and availability of mobility data

The project supports real-life implementations in nine cities and regions:
* Barcelona (ES)
* ÃŽle-de-France (FR)
* Milan (IT)
* Lisbon (PT)
* Flanders (BE)
* Sofia (BG)
* Stockholm (SE)
* Tampere (FI)
* Budapest (HU).

These initiatives focus on the development of innovative services and applications in urban mobility, while assisting in policymaking through the sharing and reuse of data.
