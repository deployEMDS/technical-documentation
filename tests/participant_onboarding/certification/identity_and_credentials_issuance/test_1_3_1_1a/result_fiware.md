### Stack: Fiware

### Statement of assessment
#### Environment

The test is conducted in the IONOS FIWARE_cluster cluster using node pool IP 85.215.161.198.

#### Tested quality metric and method

The test quality is based on the metric defined in [iso27001_kpis_subkpis.xlsx](../../../../../design_decisions/background_info/iso27001_kpis_subkpis.xlsx). For the current phase (phase 1), the test focuses on the Functional Suitability quality metric.

#### Comparative criteria (checklists, ...)
