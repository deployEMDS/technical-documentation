## [5.1.1.2] Data sharing: Data sharing request - Request data transfer
 
### Test description
Coverage test: for each data plane available, test a minimal data sharing and identify possible inconsistencies with the original data product protocol endpoint (e.g., during data querying, we arenâ€™t allowed to send http headers to the data source). 
 
### Test type
Test
 
### Execution phase
Phase 1
 
### Minimal?
Yes
 
### Extra information
#### ISO25010 Quality
Functional suitability
#### ISO25010 Quality description
The system supports multiple protocols and the ability to perform queries against the data products endpoint when the endpoint offers that capability. 

### Evaluation Criteria
The criteria used to measure the results was the one specified by the Data Product Publication ISO25010 Quality file regarding Functional Suitability.
