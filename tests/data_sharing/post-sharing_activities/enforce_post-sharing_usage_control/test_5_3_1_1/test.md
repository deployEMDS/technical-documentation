## [5.3.1.1] Data sharing: Post-sharing activities - Enforce post-sharing usage control
 
### Test description
Test the mechanism that is necessary to support post-sharing and client policies. If out of the box ranks higher.
If the mechanism is not supported, describe the effort it would require developing such function, and rank the system consequently (e.g.: create a plugin in a documented environment ranks better than integrating an external function that introduces dependencies and interface maintenance).
