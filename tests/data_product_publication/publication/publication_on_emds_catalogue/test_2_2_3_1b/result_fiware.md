## [2.2.3.1B] Data product publication: Publication - Publication on EMDS catalogue

### Stack: Fiware

### Statement of assessment

#### Environment

The test environment Fiware v0.2 was used as described in [Fiware Deployment v0.2](/deployment/fiware/README.md)

#### Tested quality metric and method

The quality metric for this test is based on the criteria outlined in [iso27001_kpis_subkpis.xlsx](../../../../../design_decisions/background_info/iso27001_kpis_subkpis.xlsx). In Phase 1, the focus is on the Functional Suitability metric. For detailed information, please refer to the [Comparative criteria (checklists, ...)](./test.md#comparative-criteria-checklists-) section in the test description.

#### Expected output

Publishing any product specifications or offerings in the catalog does not depend on the availability of the product within or without any connector.
Technically, the contents or information presented by the TM Forum API are independent of any connector.
Therefore there is no difference in publication of an existing or non-existent product.
