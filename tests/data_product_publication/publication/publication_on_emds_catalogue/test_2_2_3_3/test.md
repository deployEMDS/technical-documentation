| **No Coverage:** No technical requirements are met. The solution does not have a GUI tool for publishing a data product offering into the catalogue and enabling discovery. The system does not provide any GUI means for users to interact with or manage data product offerings.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 0                |
| **Minimal Coverage:** Up to 25% of the technical requirements are met. The solution provides limited functionality, such as a basic GUI tool with minimal features, allowing for partial publication of data products but lacks robust discovery options. User interface might be clunky, and only a few essential functions are available.                                                                                                                                            | 1                |
| **Partial Coverage:** Approximately 50% of the technical requirements are met. The solution includes a GUI tool that allows for the publication of data products and some discovery features. However, it lacks advanced functionality, such as customizable search options, detailed metadata management, or integration with other systems. Usability and user experience are moderately acceptable.                                                                                 | 2                |
| **Significant Coverage:** About 80% of the technical requirements are met. The solution offers a comprehensive GUI tool with most required features, such as advanced publication workflows, robust discovery capabilities, customizable search filters, and metadata management. Integration with other systems and platforms is partially supported, and the user experience is generally smooth. However, some advanced features or full system integration might still be lacking. | 3                |
| **Full Coverage:** All technical requirements are fully met. The solution includes a fully featured GUI tool for publishing data product offerings into the catalogue, complete with advanced discovery features, customizable search options, detailed metadata management, and full integration with other systems. The user interface is intuitive and user-friendly, providing an excellent user experience.                                                                       | 4                |
