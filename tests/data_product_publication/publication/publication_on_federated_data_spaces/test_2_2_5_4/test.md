## [2.2.5.4] Data product publication: Publication - Publication on federated data spaces
 
### Test description
Assessment. Data spaces might use different IAM frameworks. Assess if the stack provides the necessary technology to federate identities, claims, and attestations. If not, assess what cost a data producer or consumer must sustain to maintain different identities (e.g.: ranks lower if one is required to recreate identity and re-publish a data product in the federated data space. Ranks higher the more transparent the process is)
