## [2.2.2.4] Data product publication: Publication - Deploy/config usage control functions
### Stack: EDC+VC

### Statement of assessment
#### Environment

EDC Connector v.0.7.1 within a local testbed.

#### Tested quality metric and method

The system provides an API or libraries to embed custom usage enforcement functions that can be invoked by usage policies.

### Results
#### Assessment

As explained in [this sample](https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Samples/tree/main/policy/policy-01-policy-enforcement#policy-enforcement), the EDC connector does support custom usage enforcement functions.
This feature allows users to define and enforce their own specific policies regarding data usage. However, leveraging this advanced capability is not straightforward and involves a more intricate process.
Users must implement the custom usage enforcement functionality themselves, which entails writing and integrating code that defines the desired enforcement policies.
Additionally, once the custom functionality is developed, the EDC connector needs to be rebuilt to include this new extension.
This process requires a thorough understanding of the EDC connectorâ€™s architecture and extension mechanisms.

Functional Suitability Quality Metric Score: 1
