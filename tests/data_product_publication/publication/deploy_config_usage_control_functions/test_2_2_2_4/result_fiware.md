## [2.2.2.4] Data product publication: Publication - Deploy/config usage control functions
### Stack: Fiware

### Statement of assessment
#### Environment

The test is conducted in the IONOS FIWARE_cluster cluster using node pool IP 85.215.161.198.

#### Tested quality metric and method

The test quality is based on the metric defined in [iso27001_kpis_subkpis.xlsx](../../../../../design_decisions/background_info/iso27001_kpis_subkpis.xlsx). For the current phase (phase 1), the test focuses on the Functional Suitability quality metric.


#### Comparative criteria
Assess if the system provides an API or libraries to embed custom usage enforcement functions that can be invoked by usage policies.


#### Expected output
API that can embed custom usage enforcement functions so that they can be invoked by usage policies.

### Results
#### Assessment
There is no API to to embed custom usage enforcement functions that can be invoked by usage policies.

#### Measured results
The Fiware implementation partially covers the usage Control Policies deployment as outlined above. The criteria used to measure the results was the one specified by the Data Product Publication ISO25010 Quality file regarding Functional Suitability.
