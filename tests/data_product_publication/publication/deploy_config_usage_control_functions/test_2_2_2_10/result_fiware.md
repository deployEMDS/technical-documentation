## [2.2.2.10] Data product publication: Publication - Deploy/config usage control functions
### Stack: Fiware

### Statement of assessment
#### Environment

The test is conducted in the IONOS FIWARE_cluster cluster using node pool IP 85.215.161.198.

#### Tested quality metric and method

The test quality is based on the metric defined in [iso27001_kpis_subkpis.xlsx](../../../../../design_decisions/background_info/iso27001_kpis_subkpis.xlsx). For the current phase (phase 1), the test focuses on the Functional Suitability quality metric.

#### Comparative criteria (checklists, ...)
See if  policy language is extensible.

#### Expected output
Information about the policy language. 

### Results
#### Assessment
The ODRL policy language, as supported by the ODRL-PAP library, is highly extensible and flexible, making it well-suited for a wide range of policy management scenarios.  Thereare many APIs, libraries, and tools for policy development as well as comprehensive documentation and community support. However, there is also a lack of built-in simulation facilities since it necessitates separate test environments.

#### Measured results

The criteria used to measure the results was the one specified by the Data Product Publication ISO25010 Quality file regarding Flexibility.

| **Criterion**      | **Description**                                                                 | **Score (0-4)** | **Explanation** |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Adaptability**   | Adaptability for different or evolving hardware, software, or usage environments. | 4               | The ODRL policy language, supported by the ODRL-PAP library, is highly adaptable to various environments due to its extensibility and flexibility. This allows it to evolve alongside changing requirements and technologies. |
| **Installability** | The components of the platform are successfully installed and/or uninstalled in a specified environment. | 4               | The installation process of the ODRL-PAP library and associated tools is straightforward, with comprehensive documentation available. It integrates smoothly into diverse environments, making deployment manageable and reliable. |
| **Replaceability** | Replacement of the components for the same purpose in the same environment.       | 4               | The ODRL policy language's modularity ensures that components can be replaced or updated with minimal disruption, maintaining policy management consistency across environments. |
| **Scalability**    | The product can handle growing to adapt its capacity.                             | 3               | While the ODRL policy language is scalable, the lack of built-in simulation facilities means that scaling operations, especially in testing environments, may require additional resources or separate environments. |


Overall Calculation:
((4) + (4) + (4) +(3) )/4 = 15/4 = 3.75

Functional Suitability Quality Metric Score: 3.75
