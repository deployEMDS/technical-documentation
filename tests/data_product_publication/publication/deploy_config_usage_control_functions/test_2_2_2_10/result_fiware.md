## [2.2.2.10] Data product publication: Publication - Deploy/config usage control functions
### Stack: Fiware

### Statement of assessment
#### Environment

The test is conducted in the IONOS FIWARE_cluster cluster using node pool IP 85.215.161.198.

#### Tested quality metric and method

The test quality is based on the metric defined in [iso27001_kpis_subkpis.xlsx](../../../../../design_decisions/background_info/iso27001_kpis_subkpis.xlsx). For the current phase (phase 1), the test focuses on the Functional Suitability quality metric.

#### Comparative criteria (checklists, ...)
See if  policy language is extensible.

#### Expected output
Information about the policy language. 

### Results
#### Assessment
The ODRL policy language, as supported by the ODRL-PAP library, is highly extensible and flexible, making it well-suited for a wide range of policy management scenarios.  Thereare many APIs, libraries, and tools for policy development as well as comprehensive documentation and community support. However, there is also a lack of built-in simulation facilities since it necessitates separate test environments.

#### Measured results
((4) + (4) + (4) +(3) )/4 = 15/4 = 3.75
