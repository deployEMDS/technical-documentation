* The technical implementations of the `test facilities`_(see infra.)_
* The test environment, where reference data sources, data schemas, vocabularies, and usage control policies are shared across all tests.
* The tests and assessments, these are linked to the data space participants' customer journeys covering the essential data space capabilities.

A `test facility` is an environment where a pre-defined technology stack is tested. There might be more test facilities based on the same core technologies but using different capabilities, if this would affect the tests.
For instance: EDC using verifiable credentials, EDC using iShare, Fiware, …

Each test facility develops tests adapted to the data space’s technology. The test definitions are data space stack-agnostic, while the test implementat
